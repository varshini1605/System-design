Factory Method is a Creational Design Pattern that allows an interface or a class to create an object, 
but lets subclasses decide which class or object to instantiate.

while adding new features like tamil .
Have to change the whole code because now most part of the code is coupled with the English class and 
developers have to make changes to the entire codebase. 


Solution by Factory Method:
Its solution is to replace the straightforward object construction calls with calls to the special factory method. Actually, 
there will be no difference in the object creation but they are being called within the factory method.

Advantages of using Factory method: 
We can easily add new types of products without disturbing the existing client code.
Generally, tight coupling is being avoided between the products and the creator classes and objects.

Disadvantages of using Factory method:
To create a particular concrete product object, the client might have to sub-class the creator class.
You end up with a huge number of small files i.e, cluttering the files.
